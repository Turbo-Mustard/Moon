Hey everyone! I'd like to formally welcome you to the Turbo Mustard Developer Blog. This will be our method of communication for development updates, game patches, and general musings.

Turbo Mustard Studios is headed by Michael Schwarz, who is also the head developer and supreme overlord of all Turbo Mustard releases. The current Turbo Mustard team is comprised of David Coursey, Samuel Rowe, and myself (Kevin Yu). David will fulfill a creative director role and actively influence the overall look, feel, and sound of the game. Sam has been brought on to shape the core game mechanics and assist with creative design. As for myself, I will be acting as a project manager/Scrum master while contributing to both game design and software development.

For the Turbo Mustard Studios debut release, we began development on February 26, 2018 on a location-based Android game, with a rich story and heavy emphasis on exploration. We are using a quasi-Scrum methodology as a way of managing the logistics of the project, and hope to meet massive milestones over the course of the next few months.

-TM Kevin
